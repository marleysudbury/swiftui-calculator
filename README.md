# SwiftUI Calculator

A calculator written using SwiftUI. It's pretty close to the default iOS calculator, but a bit less functional and a bit more buggy.

Sparkly features including (and limited to):

* Adding!
* Subtracting!
* Multiplying!
* Dividing!
* Percenting!
* Sign flipping!
* Decimaling!
* Clearing!
* Equalsing!

In that order!

The code is reasonably documented(?) but you may find more details at [the Wiki](https://github.com/marleysudbury/swiftui-calculator/wiki). If you want an understanding of my inner pain, read through the issue comments. I will put a write up on my website at some point, probably.
